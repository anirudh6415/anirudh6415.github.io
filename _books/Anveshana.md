One of the best books by S.L. Bhyrappa, this novel tells a powerful story of a son and the aftermath of his mother Nanjamma's death—a woman who was a mother, a wife, and a daughter-in-law. It follows the moving search for the son by Nanjamma's father. A must-read that brought me to tears many times.
