Jugaari Cross is a truly unique and extraordinary novel—one that blends contradictions into a seamless narrative through invisible threads. Tejaswi masterfully explores the vast absurdities of life while searching for its deeper meaning within the boundaries of apparent meaninglessness.

The novel is structured as a series of seemingly unrelated incidents that are skillfully woven into a coherent and gripping story. It mocks the distortions of history through sharp wit and satire, while simultaneously reflecting the seriousness of human existence beyond hope or despair.

In just twenty-four hours, Jugaari Cross encapsulates the dilemmas of an entire century. It challenges readers to go beyond superficial optimism or pessimism, offering instead a raw, fearless confrontation with life’s realities.

Tejaswi’s writing is bold, philosophical, and thought-provoking. This is not just a thriller—it’s an existential journey. The book offers a rare combination of suspense, humor, and deep insight into human nature and society.

A must-read for anyone who loves meaningful fiction that doesn’t shy away from complexity. One of the most intellectually satisfying and emotionally engaging novels I’ve ever read.
