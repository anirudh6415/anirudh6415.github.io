Naayi Neralu by S.L. Bhyrappa is one of the most thought-provoking and emotionally intense novels I’ve ever read. It starts in a quiet village, where a young boy grows up with an unusual conviction: he insists he does not belong to the family raising him. From a very young age, he claims to have a different set of parents in another village, a wife, and even a child—memories from what seems to be a previous life. He also has an unexplained attachment to a street dog, which stays by his side like a shadow, deepening the mystery around him.

As he grows older, his refusal to engage with normal life—avoiding marriage, work, or social expectations—worries his father deeply. The real turning point comes when an old man arrives in the village, drawn by rumors about the boy’s strange behavior. This man believes the boy may be his reincarnated son, who died years ago. What follows is a deeply philosophical and emotionally complex journey into the concepts of rebirth, identity, and belonging.

The novel masterfully explores how the idea of reincarnation affects not just the boy but everyone around him: his biological parents, the man who believes he’s his son reborn, the wife from his supposed past life—now older than him—and a son who is nearly the same age. Bhyrappa dives into the psychological and emotional turmoil of each character, questioning what defines relationships, duty, and love when the lines between lives are blurred.

Reading Naayi Neralu was an intense experience. The emotional weight of the story brought me to tears multiple times. It challenged my own understanding of identity and spiritual belief, and left me reflecting on the nature of life and human connection long after I finished the last page.

This is not just a story about reincarnation—it’s a profound exploration of the human condition, handled with S.L. Bhyrappa’s trademark philosophical depth and literary precision. A must-read for anyone who enjoys stories that linger with you and make you question the world around you.
