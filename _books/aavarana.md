ಆವರಣ [Aavarana] is one of S.L. Bhyrappa’s most powerful and controversial works—a novel that dares to confront deeply entrenched narratives around religion, history, and identity. Through a gripping and layered story, Bhyrappa invites readers to question what they’ve been taught and to explore the uncomfortable gap between historical truth and ideological convenience.

The novel follows the journey of a progressive, liberal woman who sets out to write a historical novel and, in the process, uncovers truths about India’s past that challenge her long-held beliefs. What begins as a literary pursuit soon becomes a personal reckoning, as she digs deeper into archived histories, suppressed records, and forgotten voices.

Bhyrappa uses fiction as a powerful lens to examine real historical and religious tensions, especially the uneasy truths surrounding the Mughal era and its portrayal in mainstream academic discourse. The novel raises essential questions: How much of our understanding of history is filtered through ideological biases? Can true liberalism exist without confronting uncomfortable facts?

At its core, Aavarana is not just about history—it’s about the courage to question, to revisit, and to revise what we believe. It urges readers to unshackle themselves from the bonds of convenient or imposed knowledge and to seek truth with intellectual honesty.

This book is one of my top reads, not just for its compelling narrative, but for the impact it had on my thinking. It challenged me, educated me, and made me uncomfortable in the best possible way. A must-read for anyone who values truth, however inconvenient it might be.
