Karvalo is a remarkable novel set in the dense forests near a remote village called Kompe. What begins as a simple rural tale quickly transforms into a philosophical and scientific exploration, guided by the enigmatic figure of Karvalo—a scientist whose intellectual and spiritual depth reshapes the way others around him see the world.

Blending characters like Mandanna, Prabhakara, Engtt, and Kariyappa, the novel beautifully captures the intersection of everyday village life with profound scientific inquiry. Tejaswi presents science not just as a discipline, but as a path to realization, comparable to religion, meditation, and spiritual austerity.

What makes Karvalo stand out is its uniqueness in Kannada literature. It defies conventional genre boundaries, combining adventure, science, and metaphysical reflection. The novel’s message—that science, like spirituality, can be a means of inner awakening—is deeply compelling and rare in regional literature.

This work has seen over twelve reprints in Kannada and has been translated into several languages including English, Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, and even Japanese, a testament to its universal appeal and enduring relevance.

A truly extraordinary novel that invites readers to question, reflect, and discover. Karvalo is not just a story—it's an intellectual and spiritual journey.
