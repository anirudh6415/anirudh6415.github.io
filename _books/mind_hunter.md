I started reading this book after finishing the incomplete series Mindhunter. The insight into the minds of criminals kept me engagedâ€”it was both frightening and fascinating to realize how anyone could choose to commit such acts. I was also amazed by how thoroughly the FBI documented these cases and how criminal profiling is conducted.
