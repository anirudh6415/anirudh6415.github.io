    - title: Actor
      institution: Ranga Shodha (ರಂಗ ಶೋಧ)
      year: Jan 2017 <br> <br> Dec 2017
      description:
        - As a dedicated member of the drama club "Ranga Shodha," I had the opportunity to showcase my acting skills and passion for the performing arts. I portrayed the role of "Kali Deva" (Kalki) in three plays during my tenure with the club. One of the notable productions was "Shmashana Kuruskeshtra," which was performed at Ravindra Kalakeshtra theater in Bangalore and Adima Theater in Kolar.

        - My role as "Kali Deva" required me to embody the character of Kalki, the divine figure from Hindu mythology associated with the Kali Yuga (the age of vice and ignorance). I was responsible for bringing the character to life on stage, portraying its nuances, emotions, and complexities with depth and authenticity.

        - Through my involvement with "Ranga Shodha," I honed my acting skills, learned to collaborate with fellow actors and crew members, and gained a deep appreciation for the art of theater. It was a fulfilling experience that allowed me to connect with audiences and contribute to the vibrant theater scene in Bangalore and Kolar.

        - I am proud to have been part of "Ranga Shodha" and grateful for the invaluable experiences and memories that have enriched my journey as an actor.
