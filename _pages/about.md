With a curious mind and a determined heart, I aspire to build a career as a Machine Learning Engineer. I recently completed my `Master's` in `Robotics and Autonomous Systems in Artificial Intelligence` at `Arizona State University`.

My journey has been an exciting one—from `Interning at DRDO, becoming Data Scientist to studying and researching AI at ASU`. My passion for data started as a curious child observing everything around me, and now I’m working on AI projects like `Matching, Ranking, Recommendation, Multimodal, and Multitask learning`.

Outside of work, I enjoy connecting with people from diverse backgrounds during my travels—gaining unique perspectives that enrich both my personal and professional life. I also find joy in cooking and baking, which I see as a soothing and scientific expression of creativity.

As I step into the professional world, I am actively seeking Machine Learning or Data Science roles where I can continue learning, solving real-world problems, and making meaningful contributions at the intersection of technology and human experience.

<!-- My passion for computer science stems from a creative child who always loved tasks involving innovations and challenges. Driven by the same passion, I dedicated myself to the pursuit of excellence, earning an undergraduate degree in `Computer Science and Engineering`. I further pursued an internship at the `Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Lab (DRDO)` in Bangalore.  -->
<!-- As I delved deeper into AI and Robotics, I realized that my true calling lay not just in engineering the future but in sculpting it through the art of handling data. The revelation unfolded during a transformative collaboration with my mentor, Jimmy. My current area of interest and projects are `A multitasking model capable of performing both detection and segmentation on medical images.`, as well as incorporating `Capabilities for processing and understanding text and reports`. -->
