I’m `Anirudh Iyengar Kaniyar Narayana Iyengar`, currently working as an `AI Capacity Engineer at eBay`. I build and optimize large model systems for performance, reliability, and cost.

I completed my `Master’s in Robotics and Autonomous Systems in Artificial Intelligence` at `Arizona State University`, where I worked on research publications and projects at [`CORAL Lab, ASU`](https://coral-lab-asu.github.io) involving `multimodal learning` and `vision-language reasoning`.

My interests include `machine learning`, `large language models`, `computer vision`, and `data-driven systems`. I enjoy solving problems through clean design, careful experimentation, and efficient engineering.

Outside of work, I enjoy connecting with people from diverse backgrounds during my travels, learning from their stories and experiences. I also find joy in painting, cooking, and baking, which allow me to express creativity and mindfulness in simple ways.

<!-- My passion for computer science stems from a creative child who always loved tasks involving innovations and challenges. Driven by the same passion, I dedicated myself to the pursuit of excellence, earning an undergraduate degree in `Computer Science and Engineering`. I further pursued an internship at the `Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Lab (DRDO)` in Bangalore.  -->
<!-- As I delved deeper into AI and Robotics, I realized that my true calling lay not just in engineering the future but in sculpting it through the art of handling data. The revelation unfolded during a transformative collaboration with my mentor, Jimmy. My current area of interest and projects are `A multitasking model capable of performing both detection and segmentation on medical images.`, as well as incorporating `Capabilities for processing and understanding text and report`. -->
