With a curious mind and a stubborn heart, I aspire to be a Machine Learning engineer and currently pursuing a `Master's` in `Robotics and Autonomous Systems in Artificial Intelligence` at `Arizona State University`. 

My journey has been an exciting one—from `owning a bakery and interning at DRDO to studying and researching AI at ASU`. My passion for data started as a curious child observing everything around me, and now I’m working on AI projects like `Matching, Ranking, Recommendation, Multimodal, and Multitask learning`.

When I’m not deep in AI, I love exploring the world through the perspectives of people from diverse backgrounds. I enjoy connecting with strangers during my travels and seeing the world through their eyes, and I also have a passion for cooking and baking, which I believe is a scientific process of soothing yourself.

I envision myself to be a Machine Learning engineer, always eager to learn and create to positively impact the intersection of technology and life. My vision is to contribute to advancements that enhance our world and make it a better place.

<!-- My passion for computer science stems from a creative child who always loved tasks involving innovations and challenges. Driven by the same passion, I dedicated myself to the pursuit of excellence, earning an undergraduate degree in `Computer Science and Engineering`. I further pursued an internship at the `Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Lab (DRDO)` in Bangalore.  -->
<!-- As I delved deeper into AI and Robotics, I realized that my true calling lay not just in engineering the future but in sculpting it through the art of handling data. The revelation unfolded during a transformative collaboration with my mentor, Jimmy. My current area of interest and projects are `A multitasking model capable of performing both detection and segmentation on medical images.`, as well as incorporating `Capabilities for processing and understanding text and reports`. -->
